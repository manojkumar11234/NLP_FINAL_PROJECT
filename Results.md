#### Calculated training accuracy,validation accuracy,training loss, validation loss for the three models.
#### We could't calculate the test accuracy because there is no feature with class variable in the test data set.

### LSTM Model
#### We used 258k rows for training and 50k rows for validation. We trained the LSTM model for 20 epochs with a batch size of 2000. 
#### Accuracy for each epoch can be seen in the below diagram.
